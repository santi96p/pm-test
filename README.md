**1. Define the roles in Scrum?**

 - Product Owner: The product owner is an individual who is responsible
   for increasing the ROI by determining product features, prioritizing
   these features into a list, what needs to be focused on the upcoming
   sprint, and much more. These are constantly re-prioritized and
   refined. 
 - Scrum Master: This individual helps the team in learning to    apply
   Scrum to ensure optimum business value. The scrum master    removes
   impediments, shields the team from distractions, and enables    them
   to adopt agile practices.     Scrum Team: They are a collection of   
   individuals who work together to ensure that the requirements of the 
   stakeholders are delivered.

**2. What are the responsibilities of the Scrum Team?**

The Scrum Team is one that’s self-organizing and involves five to seven members. The following are their responsibilities:

 - Working products must be developed and delivered during each sprint.
   Ownership and transparency must be ensured for the work assigned to
   the team members. 
   Correct and crisp information must be provided to
   ensure a successful daily scrum meeting. 
   They must collaborate with
   the team and themselves.

**3. What are the Artifacts of the Scrum Process?**

 - Product Backlog: It is a list that consists of new features, changes 
   to features, bug fixes, changes to the infrastructure, and other
   activities to ensure a particular output can be obtained.
 - Sprint Backlog: It is a subset of the product backlog that contains
   tasks focused on by the team to satisfy the sprint goal. Teams
   first identify the tasks to be completed from the product backlog.
   These are then added to the sprint backlog.
  - Product Increment: It is a combination of all product backlog items
   completed in a sprint and the value of previous sprints' increments.
   The output must be in  usable condition, even if the product
   owner doesn’t release it.

**4. What happens in Daily Stand-up sessions?**

Stand-up sessions are daily discussions that take place and are usually 15 minutes long. Daily Stand-up sessions help understand:

 - What tasks went well
 - What tasks were completed
 - What tasks are pending, and
 - The obstacles the team is facing
 - The meeting helps in understanding the overall scope and status of
   the project. Further discussions can take place after the stand-up
   sessions

**5. What is Sprint 0 and Spike?**

Sprint 0 refers to the small amount of effort put in to create a rough skeleton of the product backlog. It also includes insights towards estimating the release of products. Sprint 0 is required for: 

 - Creating the project skeleton, along with research spikes
 - Keeping minimal design
 - Developing some stories completely
 - Having low velocity and being lightweight
 - The spike is a set of activities that involve Extreme Programming
   (XP) for research, design, investigation, creating POCs, etc.
 - The spike aims to reduce risks of the technical approach, helping
   gain knowledge to better understand requirements and improve
   reliability. 

**6. What is a User Story?**

A user story is an agile software development/ project management tool that provides teams with simple, natural language explanations of one or more features of the project that’s written from the perspective of the end-user.
The user story doesn’t go into detail but only mentions how certain types of work will bring value to the end-user. The end-user, in this case, could be an external component or an internal customer/colleague within the organization.
They also form the building block of agile frameworks like epics and other initiatives.
They ensure that the teams work towards the goals of the organization, with the help of epics and initiatives.
The requirements to make a user story a reality are added later, after discussions with the team.
They are recorded on post-it notes, index cards, or project management software.

**7. How are user stories, epics, and tasks different?**

 - User Stories: They provide the team with simple explanations of the
   business’ requirements created from the end user's perspective.
 - Epics: An epic is a collection of related user stories. They are
   usually large and complex.
 - Tasks: Tasks are used to break down user stories further. They’re the
   smallest unit in Scrum that is used to track work. A person or a team
   of two people usually work on a task.

**8. How is Estimation Done in a Scrum Project?**

The estimation of user stories is done based on their difficulty 
A particular scale is used to assess the difficulty of the user stories. Some type of scales are: 

 - Numeric Sizing (1 - 10)
 - T-shirt Sizes (S, M, L, XL…)
 - Fibonacci Series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8…)
 - Dog breeds (Great Dane, Chihuahua…)

**9. What are some risks in Scrum? How are they handled?**

Some types of risks in Scrum are:

 - Budget: The risk of exceeding budgets
 - People (team): Team members need to be of appropriate skill and
   capability Sprint (duration and deliverables): Exceeding the
   duration, addition of  the scope of work
 - Product (user stories, epics): Having ill-defined user stories and
   epics
 - Knowledge and capability: Having the appropriate resources

**9.1. How are they handled?** 
Managing risks involves identifying, assessing, analyzing, defining, and implementing risk responses, monitoring, and managing them. These are done on a continual basis right from the starting of the project until completion. It is essential to understand that the impact of the risk is based on the proximity of the actual occurrence of the risk.

**10. How does a Scrum Master track Sprint progress?**
Daily Scrum meetings
Scrum retrospectives
Sprint planning
Escaped defects
Defect density
Sprint burndown
Team velocity 

 - Given the following requirement, please write an user story with all
   the required items for the dev team.
   `I want to have notifications in the App when there is new contend added`
